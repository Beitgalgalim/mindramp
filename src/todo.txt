- UI Improvments in User Events (pending approval)
  *- adjust text size, and acc-settings
  - new view without parallel meetings

- Add nickname to users:
  - 

- Send message to the system to create an event (guide send it, or even users) - idea - use WhatsApp
- Permission
  - add description and show in UI
  - User management - avoid removing admin of yourself, avoid remove last admin?
  - Avoid permission elevation


- "Editor" Permission:
  - add user to the meeting he/she is creating


- Add long-press on logo to open settings

- Bank of audio recordings

- Bank of Icons

- Media: 
  - make tags work
  - search-by-tag
  - imrpove editing UI

- Edit Event UI refactor:
  - Open in view mode, and add "edit mode"
  - regular/special/message - make one field (mutally exclusive)
- TV mode:
  - key events?

- Security: Media is editable for any authenticated - should be only content-editor
